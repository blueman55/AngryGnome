<b>NeuralNetworkTest Overview</b> <br>
This unity project tests scripts for real-time pathfinding applied to a neural network. <br>
At the moment, the moveandcollide script is what is applied to moving agents and enables them to traverse a dynamic environment<br> 
It can... <br>
1. remember details about the environment it has traverse so far <br>
2. remember how many times it has traversed an area
3. refine it's path to a goal after a pathto the goal is found
4. adjust for changes in the environment to find a new path to the goal
